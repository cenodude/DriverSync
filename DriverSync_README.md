# üéØ **DriverSync** - Your Synchronization Companion

**DriverSync** is designed to synchronize driver data between **iOverlay** and **CrewChief**. It ensures seamless synchronization while maintaining data integrity. By syncing iOverlay with CrewChief, you gain both a visual and audible perspective on potentially problematic drivers.

DriverSync includes driver management, reporting, and a clear summary of changes made during each synchronization.

---

## üöÄ **How It Works**

In the General section of **iOverlay**, you can tag drivers under various categories such as "friends" or "dirty drivers." 
Similarly, **CrewChief** allows marking drivers as "dirty," instruct **Jim (CrewChief) to "mark the driver [ahead/behind] as dirty."**

### **DriverSync Workflow**

- Creates a new group in iOverlay named **CrewChief**.
- Automatically populates this group with synchronized drivers.
- Updates CrewChief with tagged drivers from iOverlay.

---
### üõ† **Prerequisites**

Before using DriverSync, ensure the following requirements are met:

- iOverlay and CrewChief must be installed.
- Both applications should be installed in their default paths.
- Ensure iOverlay and CrewChief have been run at least once to initialize their respective configurations.

DriverSync relies for the automatic folder retrieval on the default folder structure and configuration files generated by these applications. 
If you have custom installations or moved files, you may need to manually locate and provide the paths during setup.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Virus Alert**

The Windows executable was created using PyInstaller, which may (and almost always) cause antivirus programs to flag it as a threat. 
This is a false positive. Please whitelist the folder and/or executable(s) of DriverSync, or consider using the Python version.

## üé® **Features (GUI)** 

- **DriverSync GUI and DriverSync CLI**: The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing synchronization interactively, while the DriverSync CLI offers a lightweight, command-line alternative for automation and integration into scripts or scheduled tasks.
- **Synchronization Modes**:
  - **Additive Only**: Adds missing drivers without deleting existing data.
  - **Bidirectional**: Fully synchronizes data by adding missing drivers and removing obsolete ones.
- **Update Existing Entries**: Keeps driver details (e.g., name or category) updated across systems.
- **Driver Editor**: Edit or create drivers and manage driver profiles.
- **Category Filtering**: Synchronize drivers only from selected categories.
- **Preview Mode**: See a detailed preview of synchronization changes before applying them.
- **Backup Support**: Automatically creates backups of iOverlay and CrewChief files to prevent data loss.
- **Delta Reporting**: Displays a summary of synchronization actions, including drivers added, deleted, and total counts.

## üîÑ **Sync Behavior**

The `sync_behavior` configuration controls how synchronization handles additions and deletions:

| **Scenario**                                          | **Additive Only** | **Bidirectional** | **Update Existing Entries** |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Keep both systems identical by adding/deleting drivers. | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ                 | ‚ùå                          |
| Prevent deletions while adding missing drivers.        | ‚úÖ                 | ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå                          |
| Correct mismatched driver details (e.g., name updates).| ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ                          |
| Fully synchronize both systems, including updates.     | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ                 | ‚úÖ                          |
| Avoid data loss by preserving existing driver details. | ‚úÖ                 | ‚úÖ                 | ‚ùå                          |

## üõ† **Examples**

1. **Additive Only with `update_existing_entries`:**
   - Drivers are only added between systems.
   - Existing driver details are synchronized (e.g., name corrections).

2. **Bidirectional Without `update_existing_entries`:**
   - Drivers are added or deleted as needed.
   - No updates to existing driver details.

3. **Bidirectional with `update_existing_entries`:**
   - Adds and deletes drivers as needed.
   - Updates details for drivers already present in both systems.

---

### üíª **Running the Windows Executable**

```bash
DriverSync.exe		# GUI mode
DriverSync_CLI.exe	# CLI mode (command line interface)
```

Once you‚Äôve completed the initial GUI configuration or setup wizard, you can run DriverSync in silent or background mode. Alternatively, use `DriverSync_CLI` for integration into automation scripts or cron jobs.

## üß© **DriverSync_CLI Command-Line Arguments**

| Argument       | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `--sync`       | Perform synchronization based on `config.json`. |
| `--preview`    | Preview synchronization changes without applying them. |
| `--backup`     | Create a backup of the iOverlay and CrewChief files. |
| `--about`      | Display information about DriverSync.        |
| `--scheduler N`| Run synchronization every N hours.           |
| `--background` | Run the script in the background (used with `--scheduler`). |
| `--reset`      | Reset the application (remove config.json).  |
| `--analytics`  | Show analytics summary.                      |


### Example Commands

```bash
# Perform synchronization
python DriverSync_CLI.py --sync

# Preview changes
python DriverSync_CLI.py --preview

# Schedule synchronization every 2 hours in the background
python DriverSync_CLI.py --scheduler 2 --background
```
