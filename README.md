# DriverSync Latest Version 0.8

**DriverSync** is designed to synchronize driver data between **iOverlay** and **CrewChief**. It ensures seamless synchronization while maintaining data integrity. By syncing iOverlay with CrewChief, you gain both a visual and audible perspective on potentially problematic drivers.  
The tool also includes driver management and detailed reporting, showing you exactly what changes are made during each synchronization. From tracking drivers added or removed to analyzing synchronization deltas.

## üöÄ **How It Works**

In the General section of **iOverlay**, you can tag drivers under various categories such as "friends" or "dirty drivers." Similarly, **CrewChief** allows marking drivers as "dirty," letting you instruct Jim (CrewChief) to "mark the driver [ahead/behind] as dirty."

DriverSync synchronizes these "dirty" driver lists between iOverlay and CrewChief. It:
- Creates a new group in iOverlay named "CrewChief."
- Automatically populates this group with synchronized drivers.
- Updates CrewChief with tagged drivers from iOverlay.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**:  
> The Windows executable was created using PyInstaller, which may cause antivirus programs to flag it as a threat. This is a **false positive**.  
> 
> ### üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Steps:
> - **Whitelist the Executable**: Add the DriverSync executable to your antivirus program's exclusion list to avoid interruptions.  
> - **Verify Integrity**: If you downloaded DriverSync from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/cenodude/DriverSync), you can safely trust the file.  
> - **Use the Python Version**: If you are concerned, consider using the Python source version for greater transparency.

## üìú **Sync Behavior**

The `sync_behavior` configuration controls how synchronization handles additions and deletions:

| **Scenario**                                          | **Additive Only** | **Bidirectional** | **Update Existing Entries** |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Keep both systems identical by adding/deleting drivers. | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ                 | ‚ùå                          |
| Prevent deletions while adding missing drivers.        | ‚úÖ                 | ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå                          |
| Correct mismatched driver details (e.g., name updates).| ‚ùå                 | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ                          |
| Fully synchronize both systems, including updates.     | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ                 | ‚úÖ                          |
| Avoid data loss by preserving existing driver details. | ‚úÖ                 | ‚úÖ                 | ‚ùå                          |


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Usage Instructions**

### Running the Windows Executable
```bash
DriverSync.exe                          # GUI mode  <-- use this for most users
DriverSync_CLI.exe                      # CLI mode
```

Once you‚Äôve completed the initial GUI configuration, you can run DriverSync in silent or background mode. Alternatively, use `DriverSync_CLI` for integration into automation scripts or cron jobs.
